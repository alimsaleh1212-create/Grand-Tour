# CLAUDE.md — AI Real Estate Agent Project

Combined behavioral + technical standards. Follow automatically on every file you create or modify.

---

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.
- Defend every line. If you cannot explain in one sentence why a file, function, import, or dependency exists, remove it or understand it first — never commit black-box AI-generated code you cannot read line by line.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused — nothing more.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

## 5. Branch Naming

Format: `<type>/<short-description>` — lowercase, hyphens only, 2–4 words.

| Prefix | Use For |
|--------|---------|
| `feature/` | New functionality |
| `bugfix/` | Bug fix |
| `hotfix/` | Urgent production fix |
| `refactor/` | Code restructuring |
| `docs/` | Documentation only |
| `test/` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore/` | Maintenance / tooling |

Never commit directly to `main` or `develop`.

---

## 6. Commit Messages (Conventional Commits)

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <summary>`

- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `security`
- Summary: imperative mood, capitalize first letter, no trailing period, ≤72 chars
- Example: `feat(search): Add price range filter to property query`

## 8. Python Code Style

Toolchain: **Black** (line length 88) · **isort** (`profile = "black"`) · **flake8** (max 88) · **mypy** strict

- 4 spaces, never tabs
- Double quotes for strings
- Trailing commas in all multi-line structures
- Type hints required on every function signature
- 2 blank lines between top-level definitions; 1 between methods

Import order (blank line between each group):
```python
# 1. Standard library
import os
from typing import Optional, List

# 2. Third-party
import pandas as pd

# 3. Local
from src.data_loader import load_dataset
```

---

## 9. Naming Conventions

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Variables, functions, modules | `snake_case` | `fetch_listings()` |
| Classes | `PascalCase` | `PropertyFilter` |
| Constants | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` | `MAX_RETRIES = 3` |
| Private attributes | `_leading_underscore` | `self._cache` |
| Boolean vars | reads as question | `is_active`, `has_permission` |
| Collections | plural | `listings`, `price_ranges` |

Functions start with a verb: `get_`, `fetch_`, `load_`, `train_`, `save_`, `validate_`, `process_`, `build_`.
No single-letter names except loop vars (`i`, `j`) or lambdas.

---

## 10. Security — CRITICAL

- **Never** hardcode API keys, tokens, passwords, or connection strings
- Always load secrets via `os.getenv()` with a fail-fast guard:
  ```python
  GOOGLE_API_KEY = os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
  if not GOOGLE_API_KEY:
      raise RuntimeError("GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable is not set")
  ```
- Use `.env` locally — always in `.gitignore`
- Load with `python-dotenv`: `load_dotenv()`
- Commit a `.env.example` with every required variable name and fake placeholder values — never real values
- Secrets live in **one** place (a `core/` or `config/` settings module); everything else imports from there. No `os.getenv(...)` scattered across twelve files
- If a secret is ever committed, **rotate it immediately** — generate a new one and revoke the old. Removing the commit from git history is not enough; it persists in forks, clones, and CI logs
- Never log passwords, tokens, PII, or API keys
- Validate all user input at API boundaries using Pydantic
- Required environment variables for this project: `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

---

## 11. Error Handling

- Never use bare `except:` or `except: pass`
- Always catch specific exception types
- Always log the exception before re-raising
- Never expose stack traces or file paths to end users
- Define custom exception classes for domain errors

---

## 12. Logging

Use `logging`, never `print()` for operational output.

```python
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("Listings fetched", extra={"count": 42, "city": "Austin"})
logger.error("Prediction failed: %s", e)
```

Levels: `DEBUG` (internals) · `INFO` (milestones) · `WARNING` (recoverable) · `ERROR` (failed op) · `CRITICAL` (service down)

---

## 13. Testing

- Every module → `tests/test_<module>.py`
- Test naming: `test_<behavior>_<condition>`
- Pattern: Arrange – Act – Assert in every test
- Mock all external dependencies (HTTP, filesystem, databases)
- Minimum 80% line coverage; critical paths (API endpoints, model training) 95%+
- Run: `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing`

---

## 14. Documentation (Google Style)

Every public module, class, and function must have a docstring:

```python
def fetch_listings(city: str, max_price: float) -> list[dict]:
    """Fetch property listings filtered by city and price ceiling.

    Args:
        city: Target city name.
        max_price: Upper price bound in USD.

    Returns:
        List of listing dicts with keys: id, address, price, bedrooms.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If max_price is negative.
    """
```

Inline comments: explain **why**, not **what**.

---

## 15. ML/AI Specific Rules

- Raw data is **read-only** — never modify `data/raw/`
- Processed data → `data/processed/`
- Models saved to `models/` as `<model_name>_v<version>.joblib`
- Always log: dataset shape, feature count, train/test split sizes, all eval metrics
- Notebooks are for exploration only — extract all reusable logic into `src/`
- FastAPI: use Pydantic `BaseModel` for all request/response schemas; separate router files per resource group

### Modelling rigor — defensible choices only

- **Justify every feature.** Be ready to explain why each kept feature matters (correlation, interaction, domain signal) and why each dropped feature was dropped (leakage, high missingness, low signal)
- **Know your metrics in target units.** MAE = average absolute error (same units as target). RMSE = penalizes large errors more; RMSE ≥ MAE always, and a large gap signals outliers. R² = variance explained; R² < 0 means worse than predicting the mean
- **Always compare against a baseline** — mean, median, or category mean. A metric without a baseline says nothing about whether the model is doing useful work
- **Cross-validation, not a single split.** Use k-fold CV for evaluation and inside `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter search
- **Reproducibility.** Set `random_state=<int>` on every stochastic sklearn operation (train/test split, model init, CV, sampling). Without it, metrics shift every run and comparisons are unreliable

---

## 16. Pre-commit Pipeline

```
black . → isort . → flake8 . → mypy . → pytest → gitleaks
```

Configure in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Run `uv run pre-commit install` once after cloning.

---

## 17. Dependency Management with `uv`

This project uses `uv` for virtual environment and dependency management. Do **not** use raw `pip` or `venv`.

```bash
uv sync                        # Install all deps (prod + dev) into .venv
uv sync --no-dev               # Install production deps only
uv run python ...              # Run Python inside the venv
uv run pytest                  # Run tests inside the venv
uv run uvicorn app.main:app    # Start FastAPI
uv add <package>               # Add a new production dependency
uv add --dev <package>         # Add a new dev dependency
```

Dependencies live in `pyproject.toml` with **pinned exact versions** (e.g., `fastapi==0.115.12`):

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [...]           # Production only

[dependency-groups]
dev = [...]                    # pytest, black, mypy, etc. — never in prod image
```

Never use `requirements.txt` — `pyproject.toml` is the single source of truth. Always commit `uv.lock` — reproducible builds depend on it.

---

## 18. LLM Provider

This project uses the **Google Gemini API** (free tier). Model: `gemini-2.5-flash`.

- Client: `google-generativeai` Python SDK
- Auth: `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable
- Use `response_mime_type="application/json"` with `response_schema` for structured extraction (Stage 1)
- **Never parse free-form LLM text with regex or string splitting** — always use structured outputs and Pydantic validation
- **Separate prompt layers**: system prompt carries role, tone, output format, invariant rules (static across requests); user prompt carries the varying query only
- Prefer **tool calls or loaded constants** over stuffing static reference data into the prompt; prefer **RAG** over embedding large domain knowledge inline
- Cache model client, loaded config, and loaded models with `functools.lru_cache` — load once per process, not per request. Understand the tradeoff: `lru_cache` only lives in-process and clears on restart, so longer-lived caches need explicit invalidation
- Apply retries with exponential backoff, timeouts, and `max_output_tokens` on every Gemini call; log prompts and responses with sensitive fields scrubbed
- Do **not** use `anthropic` SDK or OpenAI SDK in this project

---

## 19. LLM Input Security — Prompt Injection Prevention

**Threat**: User input is embedded into prompt strings. A malicious user could craft
a query to override instructions, leak system prompts, or cause unexpected behavior.

### Rules — enforced in every `llm_chain.py` change:

1. **Always sanitize before format()**: Call `_sanitize_query()` on every user-supplied
   string before interpolating it into any prompt template.
2. **Delimiters around user content**: Wrap `{query}` in `<user_input>...</user_input>`
   tags in all prompt templates. Never embed raw user text adjacent to instructions.
3. **Sanitize LLM string outputs before re-use**: Any string field from Stage 1
   (e.g., Neighborhood) that flows into Stage 2 must pass through `_sanitize_feature_string()`.
4. **Token limits on all generation configs**: Set `max_output_tokens` to prevent
   unbounded responses and data exfiltration attempts.
5. **Never eval() or exec() LLM output**: Treat all LLM responses as untrusted text,
   even when instructed to return code.
6. **Log suspicious patterns**: Log (don't reject) queries matching injection patterns
   (`logger.warning`) for monitoring. Rate limiting is enforced at the FastAPI layer.
7. **Pydantic is the last line of defence**: `ExtractedFeatures` Pydantic validation
   rejects structurally malformed Stage 1 output before it reaches the predictor or Stage 2.

---

## 20. Project Structure & File Organization

**Separate services, separate responsibilities.** Frontend and backend live in their own top-level folders, each with its own `pyproject.toml` and `Dockerfile`:

```
project-root/
├── backend/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── routers/       # Endpoint definitions grouped by resource
│   │   ├── schemas/       # Pydantic request/response models
│   │   ├── services/      # Business logic (model calls, DB, formatting)
│   │   ├── utils/         # Small reusable helpers
│   │   └── core/          # Settings, env loading, shared constants
│   ├── pyproject.toml
│   └── Dockerfile
├── frontend/
│   ├── app.py             # Streamlit entrypoint
│   ├── pyproject.toml
│   └── Dockerfile
├── notebooks/             # Exploration only — production logic lives in src/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/               # Read-only
│   └── processed/
├── models/                # Trained model artifacts (<name>_v<version>.joblib)
├── tests/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .env.example
└── README.md
```

Mixing frontend and backend in one folder produces import tangles, bloated dependency lists, and an undeployable project.

### File-level rules

- **Every FastAPI endpoint goes in an `APIRouter`** — never in `main.py`. Adopt this on day one; the cost is zero and the benefit is that endpoint #20 does not require a restructure.
- **File names must describe content.** Good: `price_formatter.py`, `llm_insights.py`, `feature_extractor.py`, `supabase_client.py`. Banned: `utils.py`, `helpers.py`, `misc.py`, `stage1.py`, `thing.py`. If you can't pick a descriptive name, the file is doing too many unrelated things — split it.
- `.venv/`, `venv/`, `env/` in `.gitignore` from day one. Never commit a virtual environment.

---

## 21. README.md Requirements

The README is the entry point to the repo. A reader should be able to clone, set up, and run the whole project without asking a single question.

### Required sections

1. **Project name + one-paragraph description** — what it does, in plain language
2. **Architecture overview** — backend, frontend, database, external services, and how they connect (short description or diagram)
3. **Prerequisites** — Python version, Docker, `uv`, etc.
4. **Setup** — clone, copy `.env.example` → `.env`, fill in variables, `uv sync`
5. **How to run** — exact commands. For a dockerized stack, `docker compose up` must be one of them
6. **Environment variables** — every variable, purpose, required/optional. Never paste real values; reference `.env.example`
7. **Project structure** — short tree of main folders and what lives in each
8. **Deployment** — live URLs (if deployed) and how to deploy your own

### Do not include

- A list of every library — that's what `pyproject.toml` is for
- A wall of screenshots — one or two is plenty
- A full API reference — link to `/docs` (FastAPI generates it for free)

**Quick test:** hand the repo to someone who has never seen it. If they need to ask a single question to get it running, the README is incomplete.

---

## 22. FastAPI Patterns

- **Every endpoint** has a Pydantic model for its request body and another for its response — no raw `dict` bodies
- **Every endpoint** lives in a router file (`routers/<resource>.py`) grouped by resource, not in `main.py`
- **Never** return `200 OK` with `{"error": "..."}` in the body. Raise `HTTPException` with the correct status code:

| Code | Use When |
|------|----------|
| 200 | Success with response body |
| 201 | Created a new resource |
| 400 | Client sent malformed data |
| 401 | Authentication missing or invalid |
| 403 | Authenticated but not permitted |
| 404 | Resource does not exist |
| 422 | Well-formed but semantically invalid (Pydantic returns this automatically) |
| 500 | Unhandled server-side error |

```python
from fastapi import HTTPException

if not house:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="House not found")
if bedrooms < 0:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=422, detail="bedrooms must be nonnegative")
```

- Unhandled errors return a generic 500 message — **never** leak stack traces, file paths, or library versions to clients. Trace goes to logs only
- Cache expensive, deterministic one-time loads (ML model, config, DB client) with `functools.lru_cache` — once per process, not per request

---

## 23. Docker & Deployment

- **One service, one container, one Dockerfile.** Backend and frontend are separate images. Do not combine them — container orchestrators (Compose, Kubernetes, ECS) assume one process per container so each can scale, restart, and update independently
- **Orchestrate with `docker-compose.yml`** — defines services, ports, env vars, volumes, and the shared network. `docker compose up` brings the whole stack up; `docker compose down` tears it down
- Services reference each other by service name (`http://backend:8000`), never by hardcoded IP
- **Deploy both pieces.** An API deployed without its frontend (or vice versa) is not a finished project. Both must be publicly reachable and correctly pointing at each other

---
